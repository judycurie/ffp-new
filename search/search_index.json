The stringent geometric and material constraints contribute to their affordability, making them one of the most economical choices in the realm of structural design. Achieving structural efficiency with minimal materials and construction costs is made possible through restricted geometry modeling, taking material considerations into account.</p> <p>This workshop is tailored for individuals with backgrounds in architecture or structural engineering, both students and professionals alike.

The workshop will also cover the basics of structural analysis for such forms, enabling attendees to transform their designs into impressive, structurally sound gridshell structures.</p> <p>During the workshop, we will delve into practical aspects of design preparation for digital fabrication.

Prof. R\u0119bielak has been a Chairman of the Committee on Architecture and Urban Planning of the of Wroclaw Branch of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) since 2006 and he was member of some national and international scientific societies as well as a member of scientific boards or editorial committees of national and international scientific journals; at present, among others, a member of the Editorial Board of The International Journal of Computational Methods (IJCM).</p> <p>More at: http://januszrebielak.pl and wikipedia.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"research/international-scientific-council/#prof-jacek-kosciuk","title":"Prof. Jacek Ko\u015bciuk","text":"<p>Prof. Ko\u015bciuk is an innovator in the application of 3D scanning for creating digital documentation of historical and archeological objects. 3D laser scanning, modeling and simulations not only enhance the heritage documentation with the 3D digital twins, but it also can aid dating the objects by analysis of brics dimensions or helped to discover the ancient Incaic measuring units. The 3D documentation made with sub-millimeter precision is of key importance for monitoring atmospheric and climatic factors causing erosion processes and implementing proper conservation programs. Over 40 years of experience in building archaeology and architectural monument preservation in Poland and worldwide, including +15 sites from the UNESCO World Heritage List e.g.  Temple of Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahari (Egypt), El Fuerte de Samaipata (Bolivia), Corikancha temple in Cusco and  Machu Picchu (Peru).</p> <p>In 2007 he founded the  the Laboratory of 3D Scanning and Modeling within Wroclaw University of Technology and Science (TU Wroclaw), which he was supervising as a head-director. Prof. Ko\u015bciuk was the first professor in Poland who supervised doctoral thesis into digital design, 3D scanning, simulation and optimization. Thanks to him the Laboratory of Digital Fabrication LabDigiFab was funded within TU Wroclaw. This student organization was a unique opportunity at that time to get skills and knowledge about digital design and fabrication. The former students of LabDigiFab, continued their education graduating from among others MIT, UCL Bartlett or ICD Stuttgart.  During its activity LabDigiFab organized in 2015 first in Poland International Conference of Parametric Design Shapes of Logic link, followed in 2017 by its second edition link.</p> <p>In 2020 Prof. Kosciuk was awarded the highest scientific nomination by the Polish President. By younger generations he is often referred to as a father (or a god father) of bringing new technologies into architectural education in Poland.</p> <p>More at: linkedin</p>"},{"location":"resources/resources/","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"resources/resources/#fab-lab-links","title":"fab lab links","text":"<p>portal locations charter inventory</p> <p>foundation foundation EU foundation PL</p> <p>academy academany events cities</p> <p>talk presentation article book cloud research</p>"}]}

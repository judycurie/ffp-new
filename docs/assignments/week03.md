|Assignment    |                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| *group*       |  characterize your lasercutter's focus, power, speed, rate, kerf, joint clearance and types 
| *individual*      | cut something on the vinylcutter; design, lasercut, and document a parametric construction kit, accounting for the lasercutter kerf,which can be assembled in multiple ways, and for extra credit include elements that aren't flat |

## Design & Fabrication

The beauty of asymptotic gridhshell lies in the ease of fabrication. The 3D laths unroll to  flat straigh strips which can be manufactured by laser, milling or even by hand.

![](../images/week03/w03-layoutbw.jpg)

To produce below fabrication layout, I prepered a custom Python script for unrolling and labaling of the elements and joints. The code produces layout for the bottom layer of the assymptotics.

The scipt accounts for the laser beam size (kerf), material thickness, width of the material and tolerances.

The joint connection shape can be rectacngular or defined by custom draw curve.

## Material Tests
The material tests were conducted on 2 machines: Spirit GLS 12-100W CO2 (1) and Cromak LC5070Z (2,3,4).
The sample were cut with constant speed and varying power. The chosen speed is the fastest speed for which with 100% power the material was cut. 
![](../images/week03/w0309.jpeg)

The model was produces from the 0.8mm Birch Plywod. Based on the sample test the power of 40% was enought to cut the materia. As 5% power does nothing, for engraving the power of 7% was chosen.


## Model Assembly
The cut pieces were placed in assebmly order divided into Series A- bottom and Series B- top. The assembly was flat and the elements had to be carefully put into the right slots. The assebmled flat model was erected genetly with hands.

## Vinyl Cutter 
I followed the classy Vinyl cut sticker for my laptop. The vector drawing was prepared in Rhino and scaled to 50mm. After cutting, the trnasculent background needs to be covered with the additional layer.

## Group assignment

A few materials were considered and their thickness  measured: PET: 1.15mm, proipropylen 0.51mm, and cardboarf 1.45mm. The sameple test was cut on the PET sample (1).

A laser cutter's beam usually has a diameter between 0.1 and 0.3 mm. For the Spirit GLS 12-100W CO2 tested in the FabLab CDMX is 0.1mm (Laser Source, 10.6Âµm). 

## Python script

I prepered a custom Python script for the unrolling of the asymotitic laths and labaling the elements and the connection points. The cutting outlines account for the laser beam and thickness of the material.

## Conclusions/Problems/Questions/Dilemas


Scale and Tolerance problem

I tried add custom shape of the joints, however there was a problem with the units and tolerances. In [m] model the assymptotic cross sections worked correctl, while the cutout line for joints was not planar accrodingly to the software and couldnt be subtructued from the lath outline. While I scaled the model x10 the geometry operation on cutting out from the laths outlines the custom joint outlines worked.

Jumping out stripes

While the laths were placed on the board directly to each other, they started to stick out from the bed while being cut. Not recommended layout for the stip cutting.

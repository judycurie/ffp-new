# Week02. Computer-aided design

## Assignment
model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, ...) a possible final project,
compress your images and videos,
and post a description with your design files on your class page

## Research

I reviewed some research papers about asymptotic gridshells.

1. Asymptotic Gridshells - applications and analysis. [paper](https://www.behance.net/gallery/86066625/MT-Asymptotic-Gridshells-applications-and-analysis)

2. DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE ASYMPTOTIC PAVILION [paper](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1468899/1468899.pdf)

3. The design, fabrication and assembly of an asymptotic timber gridshell. [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336367443_The_design_fabrication_and_assembly_of_an_asymptotic_timber_gridshell)

4. Morphology of Kinetic Asymptotic Grids. [paper](https://eikeschling.com/2022/09/23/morphology-of-kinetic-asymptotic-grids/)

5. Designing Asymptotic Geodesic Hybrid Gridshells. [paper](https://eikeschling.com/2022/09/05/designing-asymptotic-geodesic-hybrid-gridshells/)


 “if surface is completely minimal, the asymptotics in the gridshell will coincide perfectly perpendicular, which result in torsion-free nodes and straight strips” (Eike Schling, 2018)

## Design goal

A small scale roof structure/ a canopy, which can be built without a building permit, providing a sheltered space from the rain and the sun.

- [ ] 1) timber gridshell from flat straight planks 

- [ ] 2) covered with watertight matter

- [ ] 3) assembly from flat

- [ ] 4) approx. coverage area 35m2


## Geometric Requirements

**Table 1.** Geometric requirements for asymtotic gridshell.

## Proposals V1 V2

Taking into consideration the geometric requirements, 2 subsurfaces were cut out of the minimal surface Enneper 3. The asymptotic curves were found with the custom-scripted component for Grasshopper.

**Fig 1.** Geometric comparison of the V1 and V2 proposals.

Two proposal V1 and V2 can be built as a stand-alone structures. However for the modular assembly is important for the possibilities to cover large spaces. Some modular arrangements are presented below.

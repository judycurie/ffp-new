This week I worked on defining my final project idea and started to getting used to the documentation process.

## MkDocs Website

After figuring out that I need a new MkDocs template for a personal website, rather than trying to modify the exiting HTML template in my folder (thanks to Rodrigo :)), I had to make it work on my local repository. 



To get the mkdocs template working locally I had to:

1. Install mkdocs theme material, using the following commands (source:  [squidfunk](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/))

```
pip install mkdocs-material
git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git
pip install -e mkdocs-material

```

2. Install the missing plugin, using the following command (source: [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin/))


```
pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin

```


## Key take aways 

- git push : local -> server

- git pull : server -> local

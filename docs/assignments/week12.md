# **Week12.** Molding and Casting

|Assignment    |                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| *group*       |    review the safety data sheets for each of your molding and casting materials, then make and compare test casts with each of them; extra credit: try other molding and casting processes [**link**](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/ciudadmexico/group%20assignments/molding%20and%20casting/)|
| *individual*      |    design a mold around the stock and tooling that you'll be using, mill it (rough cut + three-axis finish cut), and use it to cast parts;  extra credit: use more then two mold parts|

## Take aways from the group Assignment
[Group Assignment](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/ciudadmexico/group%20assignments/molding%20and%20casting/).

 - always wear gloves
 - put foil on the floor - it could be messy
 - resin that we use is not very hazardous but can casue the following:
Eye Contact: Causes serious eye irritation.
Inhalation: Harmful if inhaled. It can irritate the respiratory tract.
Skin Contact: Causes skin irritation.
Ingestion: Irritating to the mouth, throat and stomach.

## Idea


OVERMOLDING

## Testing

Preparations:
- gloves
- foil on the floor

The following materials were availabe for the assigment and for testing:

For the test I used the Resin - RESINA PP-70*60.
General purpose polyester resin so you can make multiple applications. It is excellent for making solid and hollow pieces, with fillers and pigments to provide different types of finishes.

Technical data:

- Fast curing even in thin sections
- Percentage Solids Right for Your Application
- Easy wetting to fiberglass
- Consistent cure at various catalyst levels
- Good acceptance of mineral fillers
- Good barcol hardness development
- To start its curing process it is required to add K-2000 catalyst

## Mold Modeling

I prepered the model for the mold in Rhino and Grasshopper (files at the bottom of the page).

## Casting

###Preparation
To make the overmolding for the pcb I had to prepare the board to avoid resing getting into the usb port and providing covers for the pins. To protect USB I printed a USB-C cover (files at the bottom of the page). It needed some sanding to fit to the port.

### Mixing
The resin was mixed with the proporiton 1 drop of catalyst K-2000 for 50ml of resin liquid.

**TO AVOID BUBBLES*:

- I made a test before making the mold to inspect how to prevent BUBBLES
- I sprayed the mold with special spray (instead of talk)
- I didn't rush the process - 8min of mixing.
- I was SHARING not SCOOPING
- I was mixing the mixture in two directions: clockwise and counterclockwise
- I shaked the mold after puring the mixture

### Pouring

![](../images/week12/week1225.png)
The mold was pressed with a weight block to secure well fit.
I had a bit of resin mixture spare after pouring to the pcb mold, therefore I used to to make a second layer in the test mold with embedded metal items.

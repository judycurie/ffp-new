# **Week12.** Molding and Casting

|Assignment    |                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| *group*       |    review the safety data sheets for each of your molding and casting materials, then make and compare test casts with each of them; extra credit: try other molding and casting processes |
| *individual*      |    design a mold around the stock and tooling that you'll be using, mill it (rough cut + three-axis finish cut), and use it to cast parts;  extra credit: use more then two mold parts|

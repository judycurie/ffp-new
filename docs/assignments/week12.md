# **Week12.** Molding and Casting

|Assignment    |                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| *group*       |    review the safety data sheets for each of your molding and casting materials, then make and compare test casts with each of them; extra credit: try other molding and casting processes [**link**](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/ciudadmexico/group%20assignments/molding%20and%20casting/)|
| *individual*      |    design a mold around the stock and tooling that you'll be using, mill it (rough cut + three-axis finish cut), and use it to cast parts;  extra credit: use more then two mold parts|

## Take aways from the group Assignment
[Group Assignment](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/ciudadmexico/group%20assignments/molding%20and%20casting/).

 - always wear gloves
 - put foil on the floor - it could be messy
 - resin that we use is not very hazardous but can casue the following:
Eye Contact: Causes serious eye irritation.
Inhalation: Harmful if inhaled. It can irritate the respiratory tract.
Skin Contact: Causes skin irritation.
Ingestion: Irritating to the mouth, throat and stomach.

## Mold Modeling

I prepered the model for the mold in Rhino and Grasshopper (files at the bottom of the page).

## Testing
The following materials were availabe for the assigment and for testing:

For the test I used the Resin - RESINA PP-70*60 wi the following Physical and Chemical Properties:

## Preparation

To make the overmolding for the pcb I had to prepare the board to avoid resing getting into the usb port and providing covers for the pins. To protect USB I printed a USB-C cover (files at the bottom of the page). It needed some sanding to fit to the port.

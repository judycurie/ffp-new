## LaserCut Parameter Selector

A device for accessing cutting power and speed for materials

- code generating test sample (with constant speed and variable power), starting from highest speed (as is the fastest and most economical), if the highest speed doesnt'cut through on 100% power, next sample with 80% speed
- a device which based on the photo of the sample, chooses the optimal parameters for cut and engrave, and calculates the kerf (arc and linear)


## Mechanism of Mechanisms
Development of the assignments fabricating mechanisms from 502 Mechanisms

- a final project as a inception of all produced mechanism in one Machine
- top down approach, as the final project will be defined only at

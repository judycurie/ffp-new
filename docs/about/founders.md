## **Judy Curie**

Judy Curie (Judyta Maria Cichocka) is a passionate designer and entrepreneur in the field of structural art. Her main focus lies in Computational Intelligence methods applied in structural and architectural design. She holds PhD in architectural engineering (WRUT) and MEng in Structural Design and Mechanics (MIT). She was a MIT nominee to the SOM STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH GRANT (2019) and recipient of the MIT Art Grant (2019). She just has set up Fab Foundation Poland. She aspires to lead cutting edge research into digital fabrication and set up a Fab Lab Node in Poland.
Judy's vision is to merge high-tech computational design with local materials and low-tech fabrication methods, aiming to empower communities to produce what they consume. She firmly believes that the fusion of global knowledge with local resources has the potential to reshape economies-  by diminishing the market dominance of mass production, elevating the quality of products, minimizing waste, and reducing both environmental impact and CO2 emissions. Judy's aspirations reflect a commitment to sustainable practices and a belief in the transformative power of technology when harnessed in harmony with community-driven and environmentally conscious principles.

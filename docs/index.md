## Fab Foundation Poland
This course is meant to be a great start to the [Fab Foundation Poland]( https://fabfoundation.pl) - a Polish daugther of the [Fab Foundation]((https://fabfoundation.org/)). The Fab Foundation Poland aims to brige the digital divine and conduct applied research into digital design & fabrication. The actions of the Fab Foundation Poland are primarly aimed for people living currently in Poland: Poles, Ukraininans and other people needing community, new job skills or a digitally fabricated house! 

My participation in Fab Academy 2023 is sponsored by Eurepean Union (EU funding: 101033646).
